                <p class='about_info'><strong>Name:</strong> Tomoko Sophia Oguri, but I go by Sophia!</p>

                <p class='about_info'><strong>Hobbies:</strong> Cooking, playing the violin, making graphics on
                    Illustrator, playing with my dog, fermentation (not as weird as it sounds, I promise), and hiking.

                <p class='about_info'><strong>A Little More: </strong> My academic focuses lie in data science and
                    optimization but I hope to take these tools outside of the classroom and apply them through a design
                    lens to stretch our limits of prediction, building our understanding of underlying human behavior.
                    Since I was little, I have always been fascinated by the idea of efficiency and how human behavior
                    can easily be manipulated with constant areas of inefficiency. Definitely an odd process for a small
                    child to be interested in and similarly, a very strange concept to be intrigued by.
                    However, I somehow was. While I was learning the violin, I would constantly think of the most
                    efficient way to memorize a piece. Was it by continuously playing it over in large chunks or small
                    sections? While I was cooking with my mom, I would brainstorm the ways to multi-task and stagger the
                    start times of multiple recipes. I was fascinated by numbers, processes, and how we interact
                    with them.
                    Now, as I've dived into my major, I've started to get a grasp on the intricacies of numerical
                    analysis while getting to know the improvisation of human behavior through my own personal growth. I
                    want to expand on this understanding in the future and find an answer to the question: to what
                    extent is human behavior predictable?
